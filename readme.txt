A simple plugin to dynamically display social media links for various social networks via a widget / theme customizer

== Description ==

Social Display is a simple plugin which creates a widget on the WordPress dashboard for your dynamic sidebars. This widget will display social media logos
or text for Facebook, Twitter LinkedIn and many more! Social Media links can be easily added and updated from the Social Display Options page under Plugins. If you do
not wish to display a network it can be easily shown or hidden from the options page as well. This plugin was written as a means to provide an easy way to add
social media images/links to a dynamically generated sidebar.

* Supports links for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, WordPress and RSS - More to be added in later versions
* Dedicated Options Page found under the Plugins Menu of the Dashboard
* Easily show / hide networks
* Dynamic widget that can be added to any sidebar within a WordPress Theme
